      <h2>Meow</h2>
      <p class=haiku>I will chew your wires<br>I will jump upon your head<br>I know you love me</p>
      <p>I have two cats, Root and Mochi. They are mischevious little beasts who constantly cause trouble. I love them both very much.</p>
      <h2>My personal interests</h2>
      <p>I really enjoy the card game Magic The Gathering. I used to work at a game store, and part of working there was facilitating Magic events. I figured I ought to learn how the game works since it seemed like a big deal. I was then sucked into the rabbit hole, and now I have a bunch of decks. I collect the special land cards because I like the artwork of all the mysterious places.</p>
      <p>I also like writing music. I've been writing music (poorly) since I was 12, and I've been slowly improving since. I currently use Ableton Live as my digital audio workstation of choice, but I used to use LMMS (a very capable free alternative) early on.</p>
      <p>A recent hobby of mine is homelabbing! I have a home server that hosts a handful of useful services. It's network storage, so I can access my documents on the go; it runs Jellyfin, so I have access to my movies, shows, and music anywhere; it runs Immich so I have easy access to my photos from anywhere (you get the point, no more Google!).</p>
